This is my 2nd and latest portfolio created with React and Tailwind CSS.

In creating this portfolio, I had practice using the JS map function, creating an array of objects, using grid layout, 
implementing React's smooth scroll, and absolute and relative positioning. 

The biggest struggle I had creating this portfolio is figuring out why my project thumbnail images appears over my mobile menu and navbar. Turns out
it's cause they had the absolute and relative positioning, which takes the element out of the dsocument flow.

I had to make some sacrifices to the design of my portfolio and remove them absolute and relative positioning.

Initially, the projects had a hover text on the images that tells what tech was used in the creation of the projects and also when hovering 
over the titles of the projects, it reveals 2 buttons, one for the repo of the project and the other for the live site of the project.

Now, when clicking on the images of the project, it takes the user or client to the live site and when clicking on the title, the repo of the site. 

It was a not easy, but also not very hard either. I took some inspirations from other portfolio designs and injected some of my own designs and code into this
portfolio. I struggled, but I also had fun, and looking forward to making more complex and fun projects.
